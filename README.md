# UmodelAutoAes

This is a modified version of https://github.com/Lucas7yoshi/UmodelAutoAes

This software uses apis from https://nitestats.com/api-docs/

# How to use
- Download the exe from release page
- Move the exe to your umodel folder
- If you have a bat file, remove your -aes argument and replace "umodel.exe" with "UmodelAutoAes.exe"
- When running your bat file, it will auto grab the aes key from a page i maintain, which will then be fed into umodel (in the same folder) alongside your other arguments in your bat file.
